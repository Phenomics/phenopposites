# phenopposites
Project to generate phenotype opposite_of relationships in PATO, MPO and HPO. We also investigate the effect including this reltionship in ontology-based algorithms like semantic similarity.

 * lexically derived - these were obtained by looking for pairs of labels that differ according to an antonym pair (see [antonyms file](https://github.com/Phenomics/phenopposites/blob/master/antonyms/text-patterns.txt))
 * logically derived - using the OWL definitions in HP/MP, and the [is opposite of](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002604) relationships in PATO. See for example [increased height](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/pato/terms?iri=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.obolibrary.org%2Fobo%2FPATO_0000570).
